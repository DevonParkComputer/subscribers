Mobile Subscriber sample application

- All requirements should be satisfied.
- I took some liberty with the amount of testing to keep things simple for those reviewing the code.
- Remaining available minutes does not have a fractional componet when retrieveBalance is called, this could easily be accomplished by using a floating point type or converting for the division.
- The output is not very pretty but SubscriberApp is pretty self explanatory.
